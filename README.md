### Project Overview:
The app allows users to input a target amount and a list of coin denominations. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed to reach the target amount by making a POST request to a backend API.

### Key Components:
- **React & Hooks:** The app uses `useState` to manage form state and user inputs.
- **Axios:** Handles HTTP POST requests to interact with the backend API.
- **CSS:** Provides basic styling for the form and result display.
- **Error Handling:** Displays appropriate alerts and logs if invalid data is entered or the API call fails.
